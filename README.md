n = number
m = multiplier
a = addend
e = exponent

This is code for generating graphs based on the thought that all n loop values in Collatz share the same exponent depending on loop steps when using n = (n * m + a) / 2^e. 

This repository also includes multi-step calculations for all unique 3n steps for orbits 1 to 512 and multiplier values for 3n and 5n systems.
